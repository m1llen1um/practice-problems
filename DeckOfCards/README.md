# Create a deck of cards

Design data structures for representing a standard deck of cards.
Implement code which creates a sorted deck of 52 cards in following order: Numerically smallest numbers first with suits in following order: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades. Aces shall be treated with numeric value of 1, Up to kings with value of 13.

Example sorting order:
Ace of Hearts, Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, Ace of Spades, Two of Hearts, ... King of Spades.

 1. Print out the deck and provide the log and the source code as the result
 1. Implement search-algorithm
 1. Write a search algorithm for finding the position (index) of any card from the sorted deck in an optimal manner (least amount of comparisons). Prove your answer by printing out the index of following cards: Ace of Spades, Seven of Spades, Eight of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds

_Hint: Consider a recursive algorithm_
